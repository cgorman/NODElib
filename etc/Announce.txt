Greetings:

I am pleased to announce that NODElib is publicly available under the
GNU public license.  NODElib is a research and development programming
library that can be used to rapidly produce neural network
simulations.  Some of NODElib's more advance features include:

 * A vast number NN architectures unified under a general framework:
   MLP, RBFN, higher-order, SMLP, CNLS, arbitrary activation
   functions, arbitrary connectivity, etc.

 * Advanced algorithms for all of the above: calculation of the
   Hessian, optimization of the Jacobian, etc.

 * Support vector machines with a generalized version of SMO that
   handles regression and kernel caching.

 * Advanced optimization routines with options for line search
   procedures.

 * Plus many other features...

An overview of NODElib can be found at:

And the actual library itself can be downloaded from:
